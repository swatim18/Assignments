    "\n",
    "Ans 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a name that is given to a memory location with some\n",
    "values, however, a string is a type of value stored in a variable. A\n",
    "string is a collection of characters (including A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and\n",
    "special characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Describe three different data types.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "‘int’ data type: for all positive and negative integers (only whole\n",
    "numbers for both.\n",
    "\n",
    "‘str’ data type: A string is a collection of characters (including A-Z,\n",
    "a-z, 0-9, and special characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "‘float’ data type: used for all floating point representations of real\n",
    "numbers (with decimal value).\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression consists of a set of values, variables, operators, and\n",
    "function calls that can be evaluated to generate a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference\n",
    "between an expression and a statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements are often instructions or commands that carry out tasks or\n",
    "modify a program's state. Whereas an expression consists of a set of\n",
    "values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated\n",
    "to generate a single value. Expressions are used within statements.\n",

    "**6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon\n",

    "\n",
    "**bacon = 22**\n",
    "\n",
    "**bacon + 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable bacon value will remain the same as 22 after running the\n",
    "code as the operation value is not being stored in the variable.\n",

    "**'spam' \\* 3** Output will be: ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans 8:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable name can have A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and an underscore(\\_), but it\n",
    "cannot start with a number. Hence ‘eggs’ is a valid variable name as it\n",
    "is a string of lowercase alphabets, however, 100 is not valid as it is\n",
    "only a number, and a variable cannot be only a number or start with a\n",

    "\n",
    "int(), float(), and str() these functions can be used to get the\n",
    "integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "**'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'** This statement causes an error\n",
    "as we are concatenating two different data types. Quotation marks\n",
    "include string type value however 99 is integer thus concatenation\n",
    "without typecasting is causing the error.\n",
